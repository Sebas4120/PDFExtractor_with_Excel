This project is based on the extraction of a range of pages and/or individual pages of a PDF document using as GUI an Excel file where the user will enter his requests. To start, in the Excel file the user enters the name of the pdf document along with the extension ".pdf" as it is stored, in this step the program will validate if the document exists. The user also enters the range of pages and, if desired, the individual pages to be extracted from the source pdf document. In both of these functions it is validated that the input is numbers and, as for the individual pages, separated by commas. An additional function is that the user can search for a specific word within the pdf file. Additionally, the user enters the name he wants his new PDF document to have. Finally, the user enters the name they want their "activity history" to have, which is a text file showing all the data on the word search and the data that has been taken into account in each run of the program. Once user has completed the GUI (excel) correctly, the user must start the program by entering: START.
